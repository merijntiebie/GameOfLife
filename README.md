Atomic behaviors:
- Determine if a cell is currently dead or alive
âœ” 0 = dead
âœ” 1 = alive

- Determine the amount of alive neighbours
Universes of 1 row:
âœ”[0,0,0] first cell -> 0 alive neighbours
âœ”[0,1,0] first cell -> 1 alive neighbour
âœ”[0,1,1] second cell -> 1 alive neighbour
âœ”[1,1,1] second cell -> 2 alive neighbours

Universes of 2 rows
âœ”[1,0,0] -> first cell, first row -> 0 alive neighbours
  [0,0,0]

âœ”[1,1,0] -> first cell, first row -> 1 alive neighbours
  [0,0,0]

âœ”[1,1,0] -> first cell, first row -> 2 alive neighbours
  [1,0,0]

âœ”[1,1,0] -> first cell,  first row -> 3 alive neighbours
  [1,1,0]

âœ”[1,1,0] -> third cell, second row -> 2 alive neighbours
  [1,1,0]

âœ”[1,1,0] -> second cell, first row -> 3 alive neighbours
  [1,1,0]

âœ”[1,1,0] -> first cell, second row -> 3 alive neighbours
  [1,1,0]

âœ”[1,1,1] -> second cell, second row -> 8 alive neighbours
  [1,1,1]
  [1,1,1]

- Determine underpopulation -> when fewer than two live neighbours
- Determine reproduction -> when a dead cell has exactly 3 neighbours
- Determine overcrowding -> when a live cell has more than three live neighbours 

âœ” 2 alive neighbours -> no underpopulation
âœ” 1 alive neighbours -> underpopulation

âœ” 2 alive neighbours -> no reproduction
âœ” 3 alive neighbours -> reproduction
âœ” 4 alive neighbours -> no reproduction

âœ” 3 alive neighbours -> no overcrowding
âœ” 4 alive neighbours -> overcrowding

Determine the new status of the cell
- âœ” 1 alive neighbour -> dead
- âœ” 3 alive neighbour -> alive
- âœ” 4 alive neighbours -> dead

- âœ” cell alive, 2 alive neighbours -> alive
- âœ” cell dead, 2 alive neigbours -> dead

Customer question:
- Can we assume the input is valid

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one)

function nextGen(cells) {
  ....
  return universe.next;
}
